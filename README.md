# Semantic and Accessible Page

This repository provides an example of using semantic HTML markup to create an accessible and well-structured web page. Proper semantics not only improves accessibility for users but also enhances SEO optimization. The project includes various examples of semantic elements such as headings, lists, tables, forms, images, interactive, and adaptive elements.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following sections:

1. **Article** — An example of an article using `<article>`, `<header>`, `<time>`, and `<footer>` tags.
2. **Details** — An example of the `<details>` tag for creating expandable content.
3. **Form** — A contact form with `<input>`, `<textarea>`, and a `<button>`.
4. **Buttons** — Different examples of buttons: a regular button, a form submission button, and a reset button.
5. **List** — An example of using unordered lists to structure information.
6. **Table** — A table displaying students' grades, including a caption and header.
7. **Images** — An example of an image with a caption and an `alt` attribute for accessibility.
8. **Text Elements** — Using `<p>` and `<span>` for proper text structure and styling.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5** — For semantic markup of the page.
- **CSS** — For styling the page elements (see `styles.css`).
- **JavaScript** — To dynamically update the year in the footer based on the current year.
